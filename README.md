Problem Statement:

The increasing popularity of biking as a mode of transportation in London has prompted the need for a comprehensive analysis of bike usage patterns and the factors affecting them. This project aims to leverage data on bike counts, weather conditions, and temporal variables to uncover insights that can help city planners, environmentalists, and the general public make informed decisions. By understanding how factors like temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed influence bike usage, we can improve bike infrastructure, promote sustainable transportation, and enhance the overall biking experience in London.
Data Description:
The dataset includes the following variables:

-Time: The date and time of the recorded bike count.

-Count: The number of bikes counted.

-Temperature: The temperature at the time of recording (in degrees Celsius).

-Humidity: The humidity level at the time of recording (as a percentage).

-Weather: The weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).

-Wind Speed: The wind speed at the time of recording (in kp/h).

Dashboard Features
The Tableau dashboard provides:

-Time Series Analysis: Visualization of bike counts over time to identify trends and patterns.

-Weather Impact Analysis: Exploration of how different weather conditions affect bike usage.

-Temperature and Wind Speed Correlation: Analysis of the relationship between temperature, humidity, and bike counts.
