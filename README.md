# Problem Statement
The rising popularity of biking as a mode of transportation in London has created a demand for an in-depth analysis of bike usage patterns and the factors that influence them. This project seeks to utilize data on bike counts, weather conditions, and time-related variables to reveal insights that can assist city planners, environmentalists, and the public make informed decisions. By analyzing how elements such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed impact bike usage, we can enhance bike infrastructure, promote sustainable transportation, and improve the overall biking experience in London.
# Data Description
The dataset contains the following variables:
•	Time: The date and time when the bike count was recorded.
•	Count: The number of bikes observed.
•	Temperature: The temperature during the time of recording (in degrees Celsius).
•	Humidity: The humidity percentage at the time of recording.
•	Weather: The weather conditions at the time (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).
•	Wind Speed: The wind speed recorded at the time (in kilometers per hour).

# Dashboard Features
The Tableau dashboard offers the following features:
•	Time Series Analysis: A visualization of bike counts over time to reveal trends and patterns.
•	Weather Impact Analysis: An examination of how various weather conditions influence bike usage.
•	Temperature and Wind Speed Correlation: An analysis of how temperature, humidity, and wind speed relate to bike counts.

# Insights
Time Series Trends:
Peak Usage Periods: Bike usage reaches its highest during morning and evening rush hours on weekdays, suggesting that many people use bikes for commuting to work.
 Seasonal Variations: Bike counts are greater in the warmer months (spring and summer), while usage decreases during the colder months (autumn and winter).
# Weather Impact:
Clear Weather: Bike counts peak on clear, sunny days, indicating that favorable weather conditions lead to increased cycling.
Rainy Weather: Bike usage significantly drops on rainy days with thunderstorms, suggesting that unfavorable weather deters people from biking.
# Temperature and Wind Speed:
 Optimal Temperature Range: Bike usage is greatest within a particular temperature range (e.g., 15-20°C). Extreme temperatures, whether very hot or very cold, result in fewer bike counts.
 Moderate Wind: Light to moderate wind speeds have little impact on bike usage, suggesting that cyclists are generally comfortable with such conditions.
High Wind: High wind speeds are linked to reduced bike usage, indicating that strong winds deter cycling due to concerns about safety and comfort.
# Daily Patterns:
-Weekend Usage: Bike usage patterns on weekends differ from weekdays, with increased counts in the late morning and afternoon, indicating recreational biking activity.
-Weekday Commute: Weekday bike counts show distinct peaks during typical commuting hours (8-9 AM and 5-6 PM).
# Correlation Analysis:
 Temperature vs. Bike Count: There is a positive relationship between temperature and bike counts, showing that warmer weather leads to increased biking.
Wind Speed vs. Bike Count: A negative relationship exists between wind speed and bike counts, indicating that higher wind speeds discourage cycling.
# Weather Conditions:
-Clear Days: Highest bike counts are typically on sunny days.
-Rain With Thunderstorm Days: Moderate bike counts, as cloud cover does not deter cyclists as much as rain does.
